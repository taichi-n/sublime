0.7.0

• Cut, copy and paste files&folders

  Shortcuts are standard: x, c, v with ⌘ or ctrl.

  You can copy and/or cut as many items and from many locations as you like —
  status-bar will show amounts of copied and cut items.

  Paths will be stored in settings file, so you can edit it by hand if need.
  Or to clear both lists press ⌘+z or ctrl+z.

  As soon as you paste, each item will be either copied or moved into folder
  under cursor, so it is possible to copy a folder into itself, be careful.
  Pasting copied items into same location where they were will _silently_
  duplicate them.

  On Windows all operations will be done via system API with all its features:
  renaming semantics, interactive overwrite, progress-bar, pause/cancel, etc.

  On other OSes all operations will be done via Python API:
  you will see a vague progress in status-bar and can choose what to do
  in case of conflicts (overwrite, duplicate, skip), however, there are some
  restrictions, e.g. folders cannot be overwritten or merged.
