0.7.4

• Add support for Mercurial, in the same manner as for Git.
  Setting "hg_path" can be used in case Hg is not presented in PATH.
  See default settings file for examples.

• Expand env vars for custom git_path and hg_path, such as e.g. %ProgramFiles%
  So, for instance, you can use same setting on different machine.
