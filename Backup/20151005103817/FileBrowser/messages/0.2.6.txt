0.2.6

• More support for Sublime Text 2: fix bug when FileBrowser could not start,
  all strings are represented as Unicode.

• ‘Toggle hidden files’ supports the corresponding attribute on Windows.
  Note, dotfiles even without this attribute will be hidden — it is not a bug.

• ‘Quick jump’ allow to create jump point — just like bookmarks; to add current
  folder in a list, press P; to view a list press p.

• Keybinding for ‘Send to trash’ was changed to S; also it asks confirmation by
  default (you can disable it: "dired_confirm_send2trash": false);
  improved  performance (no freezing app anymore).

• ‘Open in another group’ makes easy to use FileBrowser as sidebar, o key still
  opens file in the same group, and with shift+enter you can preview a file, i.e.
  focus will remain in FileBrowser view.

• ‘Fuzzy search’ is hiding behind standard ‘Goto Symbol…’ ⌘+r or ctrl+r.
