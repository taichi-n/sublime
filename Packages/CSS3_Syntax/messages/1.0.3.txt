ANNOUNCEMENT: CSS3_Syntax is no longer available for Sublime Text 3 Users.
My new ST3-only package is called CSS3 and features an improved highlighter with
a full set of completions. It supports more of the CSS spec and will flag more
bad code. I will keep CSS3_Syntax around until some time after Sublime Text 3
is released.
