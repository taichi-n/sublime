• Improve performance when work with thousands items for all actions which need
  full or relative path of item(s) (expand, mark, rename, remove, etc.)
  ¡IMPORTANT! You may need to close existing FileBrowser view(s),
              before continue.

• Fix setting custom color schemes (hopefully, it’s a last time).

• Add setting dired_width which define default width of FileBrowser sidebar.
  See default settings file for details.
